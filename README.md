# Java
  Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995.
  Java, meticulously designed by James Gosling et al. at Sun Microsystems. 
  It stands as a cornerstone of modern programming languages.
  Its hallmark feature is platform independence, achieved through a revolutionary concept called bytecode. 
    -Java code is first compiled into bytecode, a machine-independent intermediate representation. 
    -This bytecode can then be executed on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
       -This feature of engineering unlocked a new era of software development. 
         -Developers could now write code once and deploy it across various platforms, drastically improving portability and reducing maintenance overhead. 
         
    -It is used for:
        *Mobile applications (specially Android apps)
        *Desktop applications
        *Web applications
        *Web servers and application servers
        *Games
        *Database connection
    -Why Use Java
      -Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
      -It is easy to learn and simple to use
      -It is secure, fast and powerful
      -Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs
